# Tree of processes

```
 * Need to create tree of 6 processes with the form:
 *        p
 *       /  \
 *     p      p
 *   /      /   \
 * p       p      p
 * 
 * And need to output their ppids and pids to view hierarchy.
```
## usage

compile it by command "make"

and run: ./tree_of_processes

you will see ppid, pid of each process with comment

also there will be the waitpid results

it defines hierarchy of processes and show who is who
